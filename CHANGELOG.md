and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [1.9.1] - 2023-04-24

### Modification
- Updated `/web-crypto/webcrypto.js`

## [1.9.0] - 2022-08-01

### Addition
- Add `GetTrustedRanges`, a service used to fetch all the address ranges for a team that are trusted

## [1.8.0] - 2022-06-28

### Addition
- Add `GetWorkspaces`, a service used to fetch all workspaces a given user is a part of. 

## [1.7.6] - 2022-06-22
### Modification
- BUGFIX: In the last update in `v1.7.5` we altered the pre-auth process (`Authorize` -> `CodeValidator` -> `ExchangeForAccessToken`). Since we do not add an active profile until the user is fully authenticated we need to account for this in `CodeValidator` which uses the `validatePreAuthToken` fn to ensure their is an available pre-auth token. Apart of `validatePreAuthToken` also checks for an active profile, which now doesn't exist until the user is fully authenticated. We now simply check solely for an available pre-auth token.

## [1.7.5] - 2022-06-21
### Modification
- Move `putActiveProfile` call from `Authorize` service to `ExchangeForAccessToken` service. Since the authorization process is two-steps, we only add the active profile when the user is fully confirmed. Currently the only other service that uses `ExchangeForAccessToken` is the `CodeValidator` service, which is the second phase of the full authorization process.
- Modify the `putActiveProfile` method in `XQSimpleCache` to place a JSON stringified version of the `user`, rather than the `user` wrapped in an array.
- Modify the `VerifyAccount` service to `await` the `validateSession` call and return the response, rather than returning the `validateSession` directly.

## [1.7.4] - 2022-06-06
### Modification
- Remove and re-generate yarn.lock

## [1.7.3] - 2022-06-03
### Modification
- Remove .yalc package reference from dependencies

## [1.7.2] - 2022-06-03
### Modification
- Modify due to build issue, republish at a bumped version
- 
## [1.7.1] - 2022-06-03

### Addition
- Add `verifyJWTExpiration`, a utility function to quickly test the `exp` field value of a JWT, in this case an `accessToken`. This allows the SDK to fail faster if the provided JWT is expired and not worth the XQ API call to test against
### Modification
- Modify `VerifyAccount` to utilize `ValidateSession` after adding the user + profile to the in-memory cache
- Modify documentation use of `maybePayLoad` -> `maybePayload` (minor naming bug)
- Ensure all services, regardless of `maybePayload` value, has the `validateInput` method invocation which ensures the `requiredFields` matches what fields are provided to the service. Meaning, even if the service isn't expecting a required value, we check for it. This ensures parity for each service.

## [1.7.0] - 2022-06-01

### Addition
- Add `ValidateSession` service which consumes the `/session` endpoint. This is used to determine the validity of the XQ Dashboard session
### Modification
- Error handling updates: Modified `catch` block of `trycatch` utilized in each service. Added `handleException` function used to return the `ServerResponse` or create one.

## [1.6.0] - 2022-05-16

### Addition
- Add CRUD operations for businesses, including `AddBusiness`, `GetCurrentBusiness`, and `UpdateBusiness`.
- Add CRUD operations for applications, including `AddApplication`, `RemoveApplication`, and `UpdateApplication`.

### Modification
- Update the `README.md` documentation file to reflect recent changes to the sdk.

## [1.5.3] - 2022-04-18
### Modification

- Update `Authorize` params to include `text` and `target`. `text` is an interpolated text field when a mobile number is specified. Use $pin to interpolate the pin or $link to interpolate the maybePayload.target. `target` is A link that can be interpolated in the maybePayload.text. Used for inviting users by text
## [1.5.1] - 2022-03-28
### Modification

- Update `RevokeKeyAccess` expected params of `locatorKey` --> `locatorKeys`, a `string` --> `string[]`
- Update `call` method of XQSDK to include check from DELETE http method when factoring in `maybePayload` presence

## [1.5.0] 2022-03-24
## Addition
- Add `GetEventLogs`, `GetCommunications`, `GetEventTypes` services to return a payloads containing event logs, communications, and event types - respectively.

## [1.4.0] 2022-03-22
## Addition
- Add `GetBusinesses` service to return a payload containing an array of businesses related to a user's dashboard


## [1.3.2] 2022-03-22
## Modified
- Modify `VerifyAccount` and `DashboardLogin` services to return a payload that includes a `dashboardAccessToken` and `user` (email/ID)
- Modify `VerifyAccount` to take optional full dashboard access token, rather than just a pre-auth dashboard access token
## [1.3.0] 2022-03-21

## Added
- Add `VerifyAccount`, `GetCurrentUser`, `GetContacts`, and `GetSubscriberInfo` services

## Modified
- Modify `DashboardLogin` service
## Removed
- Remove `FindContacts` service

## [1.2.4] 2022-03-02

## Modified
- Modify services to use correct `CallMethod` (instead of `CallMethod.OPTIONS`):
* `GrantUserAccess` => POST
* `RevokeKeyAccess` => DELETE
* `RevokeUserAccess` => PATCH
* `UpdateSettings` => PATCH


## [1.2.1] - 2022-02-13

## Modified
- update `RevokeKeyAccess` service `CallMethod` to utilize `DELETE` instead of `OPTIONS`

## [1.2.0] - 2022-02-03

## Modified
- update `Encrypt`, `FileEncrypt`, and `GeneratePacket` to accept `type` and `meta` field values in payload

## [1.1.4] - 2021-12-30

## Modified
- update `Authorize` service to put access using an already existing, but valid, `accessToken`

## [1.1.3] - 2021-11-30

## Modified
- update repository URL, bugs URL, and homepage in package.json to reflect new github repo

## [1.1.2] - 2021-11-29
## Modified
- update `Encrypt` and `OTPEncryption` methods to allow users to bypass the key expansion method for user-generated keys.

## [1.1.1] - 2021-11-19
## Added
- Allow dynamic server URL configuration. Added new param to constructor of `XQSDK`, `serverConfig`, which allows the user to specific the `DASHBOARD_SERVER_URL`, `KEY_SERVER_URL`, `SUBSCRIPTION_SERVER_URL`, `VALIDATION_SERVER_URL` for their application.
- Inline documentation for `universalBtoa` and `universalAtob` in `OTPEncryption.ts`

## [1.1.0] - 2021-11-15

## Added
- Compatibility w/ server-side environments (node.js).

We replaced purely web based APIs such as `Buffer`, `localStorage`, and `XMLHttpRequest` with nearly identical versions that are compatitble within server-side environments. The packages and their versions are listed here:
```
 "buffer": "^6.0.3",
 "memory-cache": "^0.2.0",
 "xhr2": "^0.2.1"
```

Utilizing `memory-cache` in lieu of `localStorage` required a few syntactic updates, mainly method names. `buffer` and `xhr2` were plug-and-play and replaced the web based variants just fine.

## Tested
- New compatibility updates via a web based playground application (react), a node/express server plaground as well as the `jssdk-examples` application.


## [1.0.27] - 2021-11-09

### Modification
- return type of `FileEncrypt.supplyAsync` from `void` --> `Promise<ServerResponse>`
- return type of `locateFn`, the second parameter of `OTPEncryption.decryptFile`, a callback used to fetch the locator key of a given source file. From `string` --> `Promise<string>`
- return type of `OTPEncryption.decryptFile` from `void` --> `Promise<unknown>`
- refactor `OTPEncryption.parseFileForDecrypt` method, same results.
- return type of `locateFn`, the second parameter of `EncryptionAlgorithm.decryptFile`, a callback used to fetch the locator key of a given source file. From `Record<string, string>` --> `Promise<string>`. The superclass' method should match the `OTPEncryption` variant method.

## [1.0.26] - 2021-11-09

### Modification

- `FileDecrypt` - update the type of the algorithm parameter of the `FileDecrypt` constructor to the `EncryptionAlgorithm` super class, rather than an omitted/stripped down version of the type. Also update return type from `void` --> `Promise<ServerResponse>` which is the correct return type.


Constructor param type - The second argument of the FileDecrypt constructor expects an EncryptionAlgorithm, essentially a class for either OTP or AES. I for some reason set it to a stripped down local type expecting one method.
Return value type - the return value was set to a type called void, which all it means is that nothing of note is returned, typically a console log or something along those lines. I set the type to expect a ServerResponse which is the correct return type.

## [1.0.25] - 2021-10-29

### Added

- `publish` script to `package.json` -- runs `yarn build` then `npm publish --access public` to ensure we build out our latest updates before publishing to NPM

### Modification

- naming of the `OPTV2` variable back to standardized `OTP`

## [1.0.24] - 2021-10-28

### Added

- Expose `FetchQuantumEntropy` via SDK exported API

## [1.0.22] - 2021-10-27

### Modification

- `AuthorizeAlias` -- `putActiveProfile` added after successful `AuthorizeAlias` call. Without this present, a user will be considered unauthorized and receive `401` errors regardless of payload validity

## [1.0.20] - 2021-10-26

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` for better visibility between versions
